# PLAY WORLD PODCAST

_Meandering conversations about playing ttrpg games, engaging with worlds and table trust..._

[Play Worlds](https://playworldspodcast.com) is recorded live from voice chat on Play Worlds Discord server. Members discuss topics in and around TTRPG game-play. Like all conversations, these may contain half-baked thoughts and are apt to wander. Many episodes feature recordings of actual game-play.
