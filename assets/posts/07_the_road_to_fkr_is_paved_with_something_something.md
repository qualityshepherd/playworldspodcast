Paraphrasing Lounge chats is difficult. This one kinda leans into the road to FKR, but includes many detours and at least one BRIDGE OUT sign. Strap in... you've been warned!

Also, we've been talking about [Named](https://wightbred.itch.io/named) a LOT lately. First of all, because it's dope; secondly, because it really sets the table for talking about FKR, and/or games in general; thirdly, sorry not sorry.

Out of context quote: _"Trust your players but if not punch them"_ ~ Wightbred by way of Dante
